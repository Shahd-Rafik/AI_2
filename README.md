# 🩺 Diabetes Diagnosis – AI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning application that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical features.  
The goal is to demonstrate the full **machine learning pipeline**: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early detection to reduce complications.  
Using basic patient health data, we train a machine learning model to classify whether a person is **diabetic** or **non-diabetic**.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Commonly used dataset: **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
- Each record represents a patient
- Features include:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose Level
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
- Target:
  - `0` → Non-diabetic
  - `1` → Diabetic

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
One or more of the following models can be used:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

---

## 🔁 Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle missing or invalid values
3. Feature scaling / normalization
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train the ML model
6. Evaluate model performance using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision / Recall / F1-score
7. Make predictions on new patient data

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

These metrics help measure how well the model distinguishes between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
